# Youtube-Analysis

One day, while scrolling through YouTube, I became curiousâ€”how are the legends of the Data Analytics and Engineering world performing on YouTube?
That curiosity sparked a project.
I leveraged the YouTube Data API with Python to fetch channel statistics of prominent data professionals. The data pipeline was as follows:

Fetched data using YouTube API via Python
Transformed and cleaned the data
Uploaded the processed data to AWS S3
Ingested into Amazon Redshift for analytics
Visualized insights through an interactive Tableau Dashboard

From this project, I uncovered valuable insights into content performance, audience engagement, and growth trends among top creators in the data space.
You can explore those insights via the Tableau dashboard published in my profile.
